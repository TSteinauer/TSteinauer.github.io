        <p>I watched this <a href="https://youtu.be/0wvrlOyGlq0">video</a> by Coding Snow to get an undertstanding of a basic slider and it's functionality</p>
        <p>This tutorial however did not use JS and so I had to translate the CSS he used to make the slider work into JS</p>
        <p>The main difficulty was trying to turn the css into JS because some of the id's he was using were not the ones that would move the slides</p>
        <p>The JS is 100% mine and the formatting of the page and the css were not copy and pasted just referenced</p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

        
<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

        
<p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class its possible to find many examples online or even view my classmatesâ€™ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where i have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates</p>
